# Stable-Diffusion-Inpainting-with-Segment-Anything-Model-SAM-
This project combines the power of Stable Diffusion for high-quality image inpainting with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise object segmentation. The application provides an intuitive user interface, built with Gradio, allowing users to select and edit specific regions of an image seamlessly.

Object Segmentation with SAM: Use SAM to identify and select specific areas within an image for editing.
    High-Quality Inpainting: Leverage Stable Diffusion to fill or modify the selected regions with realistic and context-aware results.
    Interactive User Interface: A Gradio-powered UI for easy interaction with the model.
    Flexible Input: Upload images and customize segmentation and inpainting settings.

Installation

Clone the repository:
      
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stable-diffusion-sam.git  
      cd stable-diffusion-sam  
      
Install the required dependencies:
      
      pip install -r requirements.txt  
      
Download the pretrained models:

Stable Diffusion
Segment Anything Model (SAM)
Place the downloaded models in the models/ directory.
Usage

Run the Gradio application:
 
    python app.py

This will start a Gradio interface in your browser where you can:

Upload an image.
Use SAM to segment the desired area.
Apply Stable Diffusion to inpaint the selected region.

Future Improvements

Add support for additional segmentation models.
Enhance the inpainting process with user-defined prompts.
Implement real-time performance optimizations.
